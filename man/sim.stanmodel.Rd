\title{Simulate data from the prior predictive density.}
\usage{
\method{sim}{stanmodel}(object, T = 1000, x = NULL, u = NULL,
  v = NULL, nSimulations = 500, writeDir = tempdir(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object returned by \code{\link{specify}}, \code{\link{hmm}}, \code{\link{compile}}, \code{\link{draw_samples}}, \code{\link{fit}} or \code{\link{optimizing}}.}

\item{T}{An optional integer with the length of the time series. It defaults to 1000 observations.}

\item{x}{An optional numeric matrix with the covariates for the observation model. It must have as many rows as the time series length \emph{T} and as many columns as the dimension of the covariate vector \emph{M}. If not a matrix, the function tries to cast the object to a \eqn{T\times M} matrix. Useful for Hidden Markov Regression Model (also known as Markov-switching regressions).}

\item{u}{An optional numeric matrix with the covariates for the transition model. It must have as many rows as the time series length \emph{T} and as many columns as the dimension of the transition covariate vector \emph{P}. If not a matrix, the function tries to cast the object to a \eqn{T\times P} matrix. Useful for Hidden Markov Models with time-varying transition probabilities.}

\item{v}{An optional numeric matrix with the covariates for the initial distribution model. It must have as many rows as the number of hidden states \emph{K} and as many columns as the dimension of the initial covariate vector \emph{Q}. If not a matrix, the function tries to cast the object to a \eqn{K\times Q} matrix.}

\item{nSimulations}{An optional integer with the number of simulations. It defaults to 500 time series.}

\item{writeDir}{An optional character string with the path where the Stan file should be written. Useful to inspect and modify the Stan code manually. It defaults to a temporary directory.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to rstan's \code{\link[rstan]{sampling}}.}
}
\value{
An object of S4 class stanfit with some additional attributes (the dataset \emph{data}, the name of the Stan code file \emph{filename}, and the \code{\link{Specification}} object \emph{spec}). This object is completely compatible with all other functions.
